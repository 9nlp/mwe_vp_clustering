# Multiword expression -- verbal periprhases clustering
The aim of this code is to semantically cluster Spanish verbal periphrases (VPs), a subtype of multiword expressions. To this end, we used the k-means clustering algorithm. Previously, these periphrases were manually extracted from The Mexican Spanish Socio-linguistic Corpus. We obtained all the corresponding vector representations (word and sub-word embeddings of different dimensionalities) in order to statistically encode contexts information in which VPs are used by Mexican speakers.
